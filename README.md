# Repo for studying algorithms and data structures presented in CLRS
Some chapters might be extended with the algorithms related to the given chapter that are not present in the book.

### TODO:
- [ ] Create LaTeX documentation of exercises and problems
- [ ] Run polynomial regression on input and time arrays to determine more accurately differences between algorithms with the same complexity
